# APIs

# APIs or “application program interfaces” allow you to connect to the code of others.
# requests is a package that allows your program to behave as a web browser would.
# In your terminal, type pip install requests. Then, type code itunes.py.

# It turns out that Apple iTunes has its own API that you can access in your programs. In your internet browser, you
# can visit https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=weezer and a text file will be downloaded. David
# constructed this URL by reading Apple’s API documentation. Notice how this query is looking for a song, with a limit
# of one result, that relates to the term called weezer. Looking at this text file that is downloaded, you might find
# the format to be similar to that we’ve programmed previously in Python.

# The format in the downloaded text file is called JSON, a text-based format that is used to exchange text-based data
# between applications. Literally, Apple is providing a JSON file that we could interpret in our own Python program.

# In the terminal window, type code itunes.py. Code as follows:

import requests
import sys

# if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    # sys.exit()

# response = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=" + sys.argv[1])
# print(response.json())

# Notice how the returned value of requests.get will be stored in response. David, having read the Apple documentation
# about this API, knows that what is returned is a JSON file. Running python itunes.py weezer, you will see the JSON
# file returned by Apple. However, the JSON response is converted by Python into a dictionary. Looking at the output,
# it can be quite dizzying!

# It turns out that Python has a built-in JSON library that can help us interpret the data received. Modify your code
# as follows:

# Program 2

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

import json
import requests
import sys

# if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    # sys.exit()

# responseTwo = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=" + sys.argv[1])
# print(json.dumps(responseTwo.json(), indent=2))

# Notice that json.dumps is implemented such that it utilizes indent to make the output more readable. Running python
# itunes.py weezer, you will see the same JSON file. However, this time, it is much more readable. Notice now that
# you will see a dictionary called results inside the output. Inside that dictionary called results there are numerous
# keys present. Look at the trackName value in the output. What track name do you see in your results?


# Program 3

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# How could we simply output the name of just that track name? Modify your code as follows:

import json
import requests
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.exit()

responseThree = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=50&term=" + sys.argv[1])
o = responseThree.json()

for result in o["results"]:
    print(result["trackName"])

# Notice how we are taking the result of response.json() and storing it in o (as in the lowercase letter). Then, we are
# iterating through the results in o and printing each trackName. Also notice how we have increased the limit number
# of results to 50. Run your program. See the results

# You can learn more about requests through the library’s documentation.
# You can learn more about JSON in Python’s documentation of JSON.
