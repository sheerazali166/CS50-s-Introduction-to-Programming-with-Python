# Making Your Own Libraries

# You have the ability as a Python programmer to create your own library!
# Imagine situations where you may want to re-use bits of code time and time again or even share them with others!
# We have been writing lots of code to say “hello” so far in this course. Let’s create a package to allow us to say
# “hello” and “goodbye”. In your terminal window, type code sayings.py. In the text editor, code as follows:

def hello(name):
    print(f"hello, {name}")

def goodbye(name):
    print(f"goodbye, {name}")

# Notice that this code in and of itself does not do anything for the user. However, if a programmer were to import
# this package into their own program, the abilities created by the functions above could be implemented in their code.
