# Connecting to Previous Work in this Course

# While not explicitly stated in past portions of this course, you have been using classes and objects the whole way
# through.

# If you dig into the documentation of int, you’ll see that it is a class with a constructor. It’s a blueprint for
# creating objects of type int. You can learn more in Python’s documentation of int.

# Strings too are also a class. If you have used str.lower(), you were using a method that came within the str class.
# You can learn more in Python’s documentation of str.

# list is also a class. Looking at that documentation for list, you can see the methods that are contained therein,
# like list.append(). You can learn more in Python’s documentation of list.

# dict is also a class within Python. You can learn more in Python’s documentation of dict.
# To see how you have been using classes all along, go to your console and type code type.py and then code as follows:

print(type(50))

# print(type(70))
# print(type(number)) # No module named 'fs'


# Program 20

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 20~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# Notice how by executing this code, it will display that the class of 50 is int.
# We can also apply this to str as follows:

print(type("hello, world"))


# Program 21

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 21~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# Notice how executing this code will indicate this is of the class str.
# We can also apply this to list as follows:

print(type([]))

# Notice how executing this code will indicate this is of the class list.

# Program 22

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 22~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# We can also apply this to a list using the name of Python’s built-in list class as follows:

print(type(list()))

# Notice how executing this code will indicate this is of the class list.

# Program 23

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 23~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# We can also apply this to dict as follows:

print(type({}))

# Notice how executing this code will indicate this is of the class dict.

# Program 24

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Program 24~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# We can also apply this to a dict using the name of Python’s built in dict class as follows:

print(type(dict()))

# Notice how executing this code will indicate this is of the class dict.
